# edgeDetection
use Gaussian Kernel to smooth image and Sobel filter to generate gradient magnitude image then non-maximum suppression for edges

I used sigma as 1 and thresold as 100 in main function.

The Gaussian Kernel size is depending on sigma.

The sobel kernel size is 3*3.

The edge detection result, the gradient magnitude image and the gradient orientation image are inside this folder.
